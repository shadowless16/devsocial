# Like Feature Fix - Persistent Red Heart

## Problem
When a user liked a post, the heart icon would not show as red/filled persistently. The like state was being tracked in the backend, but the UI wasn't properly reflecting the liked state with a red heart.

## Root Cause
The UI components (FeedItem and PostCard) were checking the `isLiked` status but weren't using the correct color scheme. The heart was being filled with emerald/green color instead of red, which is the standard color for "likes" across social media platforms.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated FeedItem Component (`components/feed/FeedItem.tsx`)
Changed the like button styling to use red color when liked:

**Before:**
```tsx
className={`... ${post.isLiked ? "text-emerald-600" : ""}`}
<Heart className={`... ${post.isLiked ? "fill-emerald-600 text-emerald-600" : ""}`} />
```

**After:**
```tsx
className={`... ${
  post.isLiked ? "text-red-600 hover:text-red-700" : "text-muted-foreground hover:text-red-600"
}`}
<Heart className={`... ${
  post.isLiked ? "fill-red-600 text-red-600" : ""
}`} />
```

### 2. Updated PostCard Component (`components/post-card.tsx`)
Applied the same red color scheme for consistency:

**Before:**
```tsx
className={`... ${isLiked ? "text-red-500" : ""}`}
<Heart className={`... ${isLiked ? "fill-red-500 text-red-500" : ""}`} />
```

**After:**
```tsx
className={`... ${
  isLiked ? "text-red-600 hover:text-red-700" : "text-muted-foreground hover:text-red-600"
}`}
<Heart className={`... ${
  isLiked ? "fill-red-600 text-red-600" : ""
}`} />
```

## How It Works

### Backend (Already Working Correctly)
1. **GET /api/posts** - Returns posts with `isLiked: boolean` field
   - Queries the Like model to check if current user has liked each post
   - Sets `isLiked: true` if user has liked the post

2. **POST /api/likes/posts/[postId]** - Toggles like status
   - Creates or deletes Like record
   - Returns `{ liked: boolean, likesCount: number }`
   - Updates post's likesCount

### Frontend (Now Fixed)
1. **Initial Render**
   - Posts are fetched with `isLiked` status from backend
   - Heart icon shows as red and filled if `isLiked === true`

2. **Like Toggle**
   - User clicks heart button
   - Optimistic UI update (immediate visual feedback)
   - API call to toggle like
   - State updated with server response
   - Heart remains red if liked, returns to gray if unliked

3. **Persistence**
   - Like state is stored in database (Like model)
   - When user refreshes or returns later, liked posts show red heart
   - State is maintained across sessions

## Visual Behavior

### Unliked State
- Heart icon: Outline only (not filled)
- Color: Gray (`text-muted-foreground`)
- Hover: Changes to red (`hover:text-red-600`)

### Liked State
- Heart icon: Filled solid
- Color: Red (`text-red-600 fill-red-600`)
- Hover: Darker red (`hover:text-red-700`)

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Like a post - heart turns red and filled
- [x] Unlike a post - heart returns to gray outline
- [x] Refresh page - liked posts still show red heart
- [x] Navigate away and back - like state persists
- [x] Multiple posts - each maintains independent like state
- [x] Like count updates correctly

## Files Modified
1. `components/feed/FeedItem.tsx` - Updated like button styling
2. `components/post-card.tsx` - Updated like button styling

## No Backend Changes Required
The backend was already correctly:
- Tracking likes in the database
- Returning `isLiked` status with posts
- Handling like/unlike operations
- Persisting like state

The issue was purely a frontend styling problem where the correct color wasn't being applied to indicate the liked state.
