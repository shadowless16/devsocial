# Fix Applied - Restart Required

## Issue
Root route (/) showing ERR_FAILED due to conflicting redirects between middleware and client-side code.

## Solution
Removed client-side redirect from `app/page.tsx` since the middleware already handles the redirect from `/` to `/home`.

## Required Action: RESTART DEV SERVER

The middleware is cached by Next.js, so you MUST restart the dev server:

### Steps:
1. **Stop the dev server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. **Clear Next.js cache** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   rmdir /s /q .next
   ```
3. **Start dev server again**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Test After Restart:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/`
2. Should redirect to `http://localhost:3000/home` automatically
3. No ERR_FAILED error

## Why This Happened
- Middleware was redirecting `/` → `/home` (server-side)
- Page component was also redirecting `/` → `/home` (client-side)
- This created a conflict causing ERR_FAILED

## What Changed
- `app/page.tsx` now only shows a loading spinner
- Middleware handles the redirect (already working)
- No more conflict = no more ERR_FAILED

## For Production (Vercel)
After confirming it works locally:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove conflicting root redirect"
git push origin main
```
