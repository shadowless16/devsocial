# Commit Summary: Fix DiceBear Avatar Display Issue

## 🐛 Bug Fixed
Posts and comments from users with DiceBear avatars were disappearing after page refresh.

## 🔧 Root Cause
The `gender` field was not being passed from backend APIs to frontend components, causing DiceBear avatar generation to fail silently.

   - Added `gender` and `displayName` to author select fields in GET endpoint
   - Added `gender` to author populate in POST endpoint
   - Updated post transformation to include gender in author object

2. **`app/api/comments/[postId]/route.ts`**
   - Added `gender` to all author populate calls (GET and POST)

### Frontend Component Updates
3. **`components/feed/FeedItem.tsx`**
   - Added `gender?: 'male' | 'female' | 'other'` to Post interface
   - Added `gender?: 'male' | 'female' | 'other'` to Comment interface

4. **`components/ui/smart-avatar.tsx`**
   - Added `gender` prop to SmartAvatarProps interface
   - Updated avatar generation logic to use gender parameter
   - Updated error handler to use gender when regenerating avatars

5. **`components/ui/user-avatar.tsx`**
   - Pass `gender` prop from user to SmartAvatar component
