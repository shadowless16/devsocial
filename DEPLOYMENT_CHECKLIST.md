# Deployment Checklist - Critical Fixes

## Changes Made (Ready to Deploy)

### 1. Root Route Fix (/)
- Changed from server-side to client-side redirect
- File: `app/page.tsx`

### 2. Posts Feed Cache Fix
- Reduced cache TTL from 30s to 5s
- File: `lib/api-client.ts`

### 3. Posts API Query Fix
- Removed unnecessary filtering
- File: `app/api/posts/route.ts`

### 4. Avatar Display Fix
- Fixed compose box avatar
- Files: `contexts/app-context.tsx`, `app/(authenticated)/home/page.tsx`

### 5. Layout Redirect Cleanup
- Removed duplicate redirect logic
- File: `app/(authenticated)/layout.tsx`

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Root route ERR_FAILED, posts feed cache, and avatar display"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically deploy when you push to main branch.

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
pnpm vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Manual Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
5. Check "Use existing Build Cache" = OFF (force fresh build)

## Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Test Root Route**
   - Visit: https://techdevsocial.vercel.app/
   - Expected: Should redirect to /home without ERR_FAILED

2. **Test Posts Feed**
   - Create a new post
   - Expected: Should appear in feed within 5 seconds

3. **Test Avatar**
   - Check compose box "What's on your mind?"
   - Expected: Should show your smart avatar

4. **Clear Cache (if needed)**
   - In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Data Cache
   - Click "Purge Everything"

## Troubleshooting

If root route still fails after deployment:
1. Check Vercel build logs for errors
2. Verify all files were committed and pushed
3. Try force redeploy without cache
4. Check browser console for errors

If posts still don't show:
1. Check API logs in Vercel
2. Verify MongoDB connection
3. Test API endpoint directly: /api/posts?page=1&limit=10

## Current Status
