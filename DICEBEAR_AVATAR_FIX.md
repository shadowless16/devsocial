# ðŸŽ¨ DiceBear Avatar Fix - Posts Disappearing Issue

## Problem
Posts from users with DiceBear avatars were disappearing after page refresh. Comments from these users would also disappear.

## Root Cause
The `gender` field was not being passed from the backend API to the frontend, causing the DiceBear avatar generation to fail. When avatar generation failed, the entire post/comment would not render properly.

## Solution
Updated the following files to include the `gender` field in the author data:

### 1. `/app/api/posts/route.ts`
- Added `gender` to the author select fields in both GET and POST endpoints
- Added `displayName` to the select fields
- Updated the post transformation to include `gender` in the author object

### 2. `/app/api/comments/[postId]/route.ts`
- Added `gender` to all author populate calls (GET and POST)
- This ensures comments display correctly with DiceBear avatars

### 3. `/components/feed/FeedItem.tsx`
- Added `gender?: 'male' | 'female' | 'other'` to Post interface
- Added `gender?: 'male' | 'female' | 'other'` to Comment interface

### 4. `/components/ui/smart-avatar.tsx`
- Added `gender` prop to SmartAvatarProps interface
- Updated `displaySrc` useMemo to use gender when generating DiceBear avatars
- Updated onError handler to use gender when regenerating avatars

### 5. `/components/ui/user-avatar.tsx`
- Updated to pass `gender` prop from user to SmartAvatar component

## How It Works Now

1. **Backend**: API endpoints now fetch and return the `gender` field for all users
2. **Frontend**: Components receive the gender field and pass it to avatar generation
3. **DiceBear**: Avatar generation uses gender to select appropriate avatar styles:
   - Female: `bigSmile` or `avataaars`
   - Male: `thumbs` or `avataaars`
   - Other/undefined: Random selection from all styles

## Testing
After this fix:
- âœ… Posts from users with DiceBear avatars now display correctly
- âœ… Comments from users with DiceBear avatars now persist after refresh
- âœ… Avatars are generated consistently based on username and gender
- âœ… No more disappearing posts or comments

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/posts/route.ts`
2. `app/api/comments/[postId]/route.ts`
3. `components/feed/FeedItem.tsx`
4. `components/ui/smart-avatar.tsx`
5. `components/ui/user-avatar.tsx`
