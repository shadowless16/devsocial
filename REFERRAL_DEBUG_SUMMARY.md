# Referral System Debug Tools - Summary

I've created a comprehensive set of debugging tools for your referral system. Here's what's available:

## 🛠️ Tools Created

### 1. **MCP Server** (`mcp-server/referral-debug.js`)
A Model Context Protocol server with these capabilities:
- `check_akdavid_referrals` - Detailed analysis of AkDavid's referrals
- `debug_referral_system` - System-wide referral debug info
- `validate_referral_code` - Test specific referral codes
- `fix_pending_referrals` - Auto-fix stuck referrals
- `get_referral_stats` - User-specific referral statistics

### 2. **Debug Scripts**
- `scripts/debug-referral-node.js` - Simple Node.js script to check AkDavid's referrals
- `scripts/debug-referral-simple.ts` - TypeScript version
- `scripts/test-referral-signup-flow.js` - Test the signup flow with referral codes

### 3. **NPM Scripts** (added to package.json)
```bash
pnpm run debug:referrals          # Check AkDavid's referrals
pnpm run test:referral-signup     # Test signup flow
pnpm run mcp:referral-debug       # Run MCP server
```

### 4. **Windows Batch File** (`debug-referrals.bat`)
Interactive menu for easy access to all tools

## 🔍 What These Tools Will Show You

### For AkDavid Specifically:
- ✅ User account details (username, email, XP)
- 📧 Referral code status (exists/missing)
- 📤 All referrals he's made (with status)
- 🔧 Pending referrals that should be completed
- 🧪 Referral code validation test
- 📊 Comprehensive statistics

### Common Issues They'll Detect:
1. **Missing referral code** - If AkDavid doesn't have one
2. **Stuck pending referrals** - Users with 25+ XP but referral still pending
3. **Invalid referral codes** - Codes that don't validate properly
4. **Signup flow problems** - Issues in the referral creation process

## 🚨 Current Issue (Database Connection)

The script couldn't connect to your MongoDB. This could be:
- Network connectivity issue
- MongoDB Atlas cluster sleeping
- Environment variables not loaded properly
- VPN/firewall blocking connection

## 🔧 How to Use When Database is Available

### Quick Check:
```bash
# Run the interactive menu
./debug-referrals.bat

# Or run directly
pnpm run debug:referrals
```

### Expected Output:
```
✅ Connected to database
👤 Found AkDavid: AkDavid (akdavid@example.com)
📧 Referral Code: AKDA1234ABCD
⭐ Current XP: 150

📤 REFERRALS MADE BY AKDAVID (3 total):
1. john_doe (@john@example.com)
   Status: completed
   Created: 2024-01-15
   Referred User XP: 75
   Completed: 2024-01-16

🔧 CHECKING FOR COMPLETION ISSUES:
⚠️  Found 1 pending referrals
🔍 Checking: jane_smith
   Current XP: 45
   🔥 ISSUE: User has enough XP but referral is still pending!
   🔧 This referral should be completed automatically
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Fix Database Connection**
   - Check your `.env.local` file has correct MONGODB_URI
   - Ensure MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
   - Test connection: `pnpm run dev` and check if app connects

2. **Run the Debug Tools**
   ```bash
   pnpm run debug:referrals
   ```

3. **Check for Issues**
   - Missing referral code for AkDavid
   - Pending referrals with sufficient XP
   - Signup flow problems

4. **Fix Issues Found**
   - The tools will attempt auto-fixes where possible
   - Manual fixes documented in `REFERRAL_DEBUG_GUIDE.md`

## 🔗 Follow Provider Error Fix

The "useFollow must be used within a FollowProvider" error is likely happening because:
1. Some component is using `useFollow` hook outside the provider tree
2. The component is rendering before providers are initialized

**Your FollowProvider is correctly set up** in `app/providers.tsx`. The issue is probably in a component that's not wrapped by the providers.
