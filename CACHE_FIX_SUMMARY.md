# Cache Fix Summary - Quick Reference

## The Problem 🔴
Users seeing 3-day-old posts. New devices show fresh content, but existing users have stale cache.

## The Solution ✅

### 4 Key Changes Made:

1. **Service Worker** (`public/sw.js`)
   - ❌ Was caching ALL requests including API calls
   - ✅ Now NEVER caches `/api/*` endpoints
   - ✅ Network-first for dynamic pages
   - ✅ Bumped version to v3 to clear old caches

2. **API Client** (`lib/api-client.ts`)
   - ❌ Posts were cached for minutes
   - ✅ Posts now NEVER cached
   - ✅ Dashboard NEVER cached
   - ✅ Reduced all cache TTLs (5min → 2min, 2min → 30sec)

3. **Session Cache** (`lib/session-interceptor.ts`)
   - ❌ 2-minute session cache
   - ✅ 30-second session cache

4. **Cache Buster** (`lib/cache-buster.ts` - NEW)
   - ✅ Auto-clears old caches on app load
   - ✅ Version-based cache invalidation
   - ✅ No manual cache clearing needed

## What Users Will See 🎯

✅ Fresh posts immediately  
✅ New posts appear in real-time  
✅ No more stale 3-day-old content  
✅ Automatic cache refresh  
✅ No need to manually clear cache  

## Deployment 🚀

Just deploy - everything is automatic:
1. Service worker auto-updates
2. Cache buster runs on first load
3. Old caches cleared automatically
4. Users see fresh content immediately

## Files Changed

- ✏️ `public/sw.js` - Service worker cache strategy
- ✏️ `lib/api-client.ts` - API cache configuration
- ✏️ `lib/session-interceptor.ts` - Session cache duration
- ✏️ `app/providers.tsx` - Added cache buster import
- ➕ `lib/cache-buster.ts` - NEW automatic cache clearing
- 📄 `CACHE_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Full documentation
- 📄 `SESSION_TIMEOUT_FIX.md` - Previous session fix docs

## Testing

After deployment, verify:
1. Open app → should see latest posts
2. Create new post → appears immediately in feed
3. Refresh page → still shows latest posts
4. Check console → should see "Cache cleared successfully"

## Rollback (if needed)

```bash
git checkout HEAD~1 -- public/sw.js lib/api-client.ts lib/session-interceptor.ts app/providers.tsx
git rm lib/cache-buster.ts
```
