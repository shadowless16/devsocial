# Session Timeout Fix - User Logout Issue

## Problem
Users were being logged out after less than 10 minutes of inactivity, causing frustration and poor user experience.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Short Session Duration**: JWT and session maxAge was set to only 7 days, but the real issue was the aggressive refetch interval
2. **Aggressive Session Refetch**: Session was being refetched every 5 minutes, causing unnecessary server load and potential timeout issues
3. **Hardcoded Override**: The `providers.tsx` file was overriding the centralized auth config with a 5-minute refetch interval
4. **Missing Cookie Configuration**: No explicit cookie maxAge was set, potentially causing browser-level session expiration

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended Session Duration (`lib/auth.ts`)
```typescript
session: {
  strategy: "jwt" as const,
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // Changed from 7 days to 30 days
  updateAge: 24 * 60 * 60, // Update session only once per day
},
jwt: {
  maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // Changed from 7 days to 30 days
},
```

### 2. Added Explicit Cookie Configuration (`lib/auth.ts`)
```typescript
cookies: {
  sessionToken: {
    name: `next-auth.session-token`,
    options: {
      httpOnly: true,
      sameSite: 'lax',
      path: '/',
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
      maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
    },
  },
},
```

### 3. Increased Refetch Interval (`lib/auth-config.ts`)
```typescript
export const authConfig: Partial<SessionProviderProps> = {
  refetchInterval: 30 * 60, // Changed from 5 minutes to 30 minutes
  refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
  refetchWhenOffline: false,
};
```

### 4. Extended Session Cache Duration (`lib/auth-config.ts`)
```typescript
export const sessionCacheConfig = {
  duration: 30 * 60 * 1000, // Changed from 5 minutes to 30 minutes
  debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
};
```

### 5. Removed Hardcoded Override (`app/providers.tsx`)
```typescript
// BEFORE
<SessionProvider 
  {...authConfig}
  refetchInterval={5 * 60} // This was overriding the config
  refetchOnWindowFocus={false}
>

// AFTER
<SessionProvider 
  {...authConfig}
>
```

## Expected Results

✅ Users will stay logged in for up to 30 days of inactivity
✅ Session checks reduced from every 5 minutes to every 30 minutes
✅ Reduced server load from unnecessary session validation
✅ Better user experience with persistent sessions
✅ Cookies will persist in browser for 30 days

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login and Wait**: Login and leave the browser idle for 15-20 minutes, verify user stays logged in
2. **Browser Restart**: Login, close browser, reopen after 1 hour, verify session persists
3. **Multiple Tabs**: Open multiple tabs, verify session is consistent across all tabs
4. **Network Issues**: Test with intermittent network connectivity
5. **Long Sessions**: Test with sessions lasting several hours/days

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- No environment variable changes needed
- Users will need to re-login once after deployment to get new session duration
- Old sessions (7-day) will expire naturally, new sessions will have 30-day duration

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics after deployment:
- Session expiration rate (should decrease significantly)
- User complaints about logouts (should drop to near zero)
- Server load from `/api/auth/session` endpoint (should decrease)
- Average session duration (should increase)

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, revert these files:
1. `lib/auth.ts`
2. `lib/auth-config.ts`
3. `app/providers.tsx`

Run: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- lib/auth.ts lib/auth-config.ts app/providers.tsx`
